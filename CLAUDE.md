# Language

Always respond in **Portuguese (pt-BR)**. Internal processing, code analysis, and reasoning can be done in English, but all final responses, explanations, and communications to the user must be in Portuguese.

Technical terms, code identifiers, and proper nouns should remain in their original form (English).
